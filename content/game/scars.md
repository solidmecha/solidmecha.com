Stochastic cellular automata rule simulator. The probability of a cell being alive next generation is equal to the sum of its region's base probability, the region's living neighbors change value times their weights, and the region's dead neighbors change value times their weights. Try overlapping regions for interesting effects. you can click and drag to change region dimensions as well as using sliders. 'R' will restart.  *A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns.*
