Catch the spy! Your security forces can only move 1 city at a time and will spend a ticket. You'll get 1 ticket per round.
On the left you can see some info about the spy's route. In Itinerary mode, the color of the spy's next move is displayed.
In ticket mode, you will see what tickets the spy has and which is spent after he moves. To win, you must have an agent
in position to be where the spy will be at the start of the next turn. Right-click to mark a city.
