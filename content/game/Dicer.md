Dice are scored if they are part of a group as large as the value of that die. Groups are made up of same number die touching one another immediately diagonal or adjacent. For example, 1 will not score unless it touches
no other 1's and is in a group all by itself, 2 will not score unless it touches exactly one other 2 and so on. The buttons at the bottom will toggle the column from randomly rolling. A fun problem I thought about while putting this
one together is: Out of the 10,314,424,798,490,535,546,171,949,056 possible board positions, in how many of them is
every die scored?
