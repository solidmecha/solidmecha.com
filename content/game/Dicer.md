Dice are scored if they are in a group that are all immediately diagonal or adjacent to one another and the number of members of the group is the same as the value of an individual die. For example, 1 will not score unless it touches
no other 1's and is in a group all by itself, 2 will not score unless it touches exactly one other 2 and so on. The buttons at the bottom will toggle the column from randomly rolling. A fun problem I thought about while putting this
one together is: Out of the 10,314,424,798,490,535,546,171,949,056 possible board positions, in how many of them is
every die scored?
