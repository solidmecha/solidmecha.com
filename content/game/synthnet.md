Drag modules to the grid to build your rig. R or right click with a module selected to rotate it. It is recommended that runners have at least 1 Heart charged and intact at all times. Bolts will charge their module and any immeadiately adjacent. Wrenches will do the same to repair damage. Click a subroutine to target it using Viruses to reduce it's cost to 1 and the appropriate symbol to break it. Click a clock icon to pass. Passing twice will recharge bolts.
