Use resources to develop this growing land. Watch out for robbers. Roads and Tracks must match up. Rivers can flow into lake tiles.  Right click a tile in hand to rotate. Each village can build a unit for an adjacent tile as long as that tile allows the matching type of transit. Move a die to a piece to give it movement. Match dice to generate resources which units can pick up and stockpile Stockpile each of the 5 on a single tile to build your next village. 'S' or Space will show your Stats. 'R' to Restart.
