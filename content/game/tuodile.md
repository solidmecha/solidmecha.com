Inspired by the undecidability of domino tiling. Try to get 4 or more colored tiles in rows or columns with adjacent tiles sharing colors where they meet. Score more points by setting up consecutive combos. Left and Right Arrows to move the active tile. Down Arrow will soft drop. Up Arrow or Space for sonic drop. Shift for Hold Rotations and reflections are achieved by colliding those blocks with a colored tile. Additional commands: 'F' to increase gravity, 'G' to decrease gravity, 'Delete' to skip, 'R' to Restart
